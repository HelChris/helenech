        <h1 class="cherry-swash-regular h1-about">Welcome, I'm Helene,</h1>
        <p class="skills-p about-p">I am currently pursuing a degree in Front-End Development at Noroff Vocational
          School, while working full-time as a
          Kindergarten teacher. My journey into web development began with a high school project where I created a
          "newspaper"
          webpage. Although it was a short-lived project that only existed locally, it sparked my interest in web
          development.</p>
        <p class="skills-p about-p">After graduating from high school with a focus on Media and Communication, I
          initially aimed to become something like a journalist or photographer and display my work online. However, I
          found myself in a "temporary" job at a kindergarten, which led to a
          bachelor's
          degree and eventually a decade-long career in early childhood education. During this time, I returned to
          university to
          further my studies, focusing on training future kindergarten teachers.</p>
        <p class="skills-p about-p">Through these experiences, I discovered a passion for continuous learning and
          decided to return to my interest in
          programming and web development. Today, I am dedicated to building innovative and responsive web applications.
          I take
          pride in writing semantic HTML and am committed to mastering CSS, despite our current love/hate relationship.
        </p>
        <p class="skills-p about-p">I am excited about the future and look forward to creating impactful and
          user-friendly web solutions.</p>
