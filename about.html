        <h1 class="cherry-swash-regular h1-about">Welcome, I'm Helene,</h1>
        <p class="skills-p about-p"><b>I study Front-End Development at Noroff Vocational School.</b> <br>I'm a
          part-time student and
          a full-time Kindergarten teacher.</p>
        <p class="skills-p about-p">The first ever webpage I built was a "newspaper" for a high school project. It was
          short lived and ever only lived locally on my computer, but it was a fun project.
        <p class="skills-p about-p">After I graduated highschool Media and communication - a study preparation
          programme,
          I intended to become a journalist or work with media somehow, somewhere..</p>
        <p class="skills-p about-p">What I found was a "temporary" job in a kindergarden, then a bachelors
          degree. Then 10
          years later I went back to the university to study some more, this time how to teach and guide others becoming
          kindergarten-teachers. What I learned was that I really love to study and that it's time for me to turn back
          to
          programming and computers.
        </p>
        <p class="skills-p about-p"><b>..so here I am today.</b> Enjoying building things online. I dream big and I'm
          looking forward to building cool and useful things. I'm intending to kick
          ass in <i>responsive web design</i>, I really like how <i>semantic</i> I can make my HTML now and I will one
          day
          be
          absolutely <u>awesome</u> in my CSS skills (which I right now have a love/hate relationship with).</p>
